Authors: Jon Fast
Class: CSCI 481
Language: C++11

Desription: A compiler for a Mikropascal dialect using C++.

Notes:
------
- A Visual Studio 2013 solution file is provided for compilation. Just compile and run.

Descriptions:
-------------
Standard.hpp - A header file containing most standard includes needed for compilation.
FiniteAutomata.hpp - A header only library containing FSA constructs.
Input.hpp/Input.cpp - A general purpose class for getting input into the program.
Scanner.hpp/Scanner.cpp - A class for scanning Mikropascal tokens from an Input class stream.
Parser.hpp/Parser.cpp - A class for parsing a Mikropascal grammar given Mikropascal tokens from a Scanner class.
Tokens.hpp - A list of Mikropascal tokens and accessors.
Rules.hpp - A list of tokens and grammar rules and their accessors.
Symbols.hpp/Symbols.cpp - A symbol table implementation for Mikropascal.
SemanticAnalyzer.hpp/SemanticAnalyzer.cpp - A semantic analyzer for evaluating scoping, abstract tree generator, and a code generation facility.
Structures.hpp - Miscellaneous data structures (if necessary, can be removed).
Helper.hpp - A list of helper functions for displaying output, errors, etc.
Tests.hpp - Tests of each class, and the driver for the compile chain.
